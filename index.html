                    <p cite="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/"><b><i>The youngest son of Debendranath Tagore, who established the Brahmo Samaj, a new religious organization in Bengal in the 1800s that sought to reinstate Hinduism's ultimate monistic basis from the Upanishads, was Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1914). He received his education at home, and although he was transferred to England at seventeen to complete his formal education, he never returned. As he grew older, he oversaw the family estates and his multifaceted literary pursuits. He felt a strong connection to humanity through this endeavour, which piqued his interest in social improvements. In Shantiniketan, he also founded an experimental school to test his Upanishadic educational theories. Gandhi, the political founder of modern India, was his close friend, and he occasionally participated in the Indian nationalist struggle in his own non-sentimental and imaginative style. The then-ruling British Government knighted Tagore in 1915, but he surrendered the title a few years later to protest British policy in India.</i></b></p>
